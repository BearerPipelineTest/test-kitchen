A Test-Kitchen *provisioner* takes care of configuring the compute instance provided by the *driver*. This is most commonly a configuration management framework like Chef or the Shell provisioner, both of which are included in test-kitchen by default.

Other provisioners:

* [kitchen-ansible](https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-ansible)
* [kitchen-puppet](https://github.com/neillturner/kitchen-puppet)
* [kitchen-dsc](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-dsc)
