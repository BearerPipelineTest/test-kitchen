Now it's time to introduce to the **test** meta-action which helps you automate all the previous actions so far into one command. Checking `kitchen list`, the "Last Action" of our instance should be "Verified". With this in mind, let's run `kitchen test`:

There's only one remaining action left that needs a mention: the **Destroy Action** which as one might expect, destroys the instance. With this in mind, here's what kitchen is doing in the **Test Action**:

1. Destroys the instance if it exists
2. Creates the instance
3. Converges the instance
4. Verifies the instance with InSpec
5. Destroys the instance

A few details with regards to test:

* Kitchen will abort the run on the instance at the first sign of trouble. This means that if your Chef run fails then InSpec won't be run and the instance won't be destroyed. This gives you a chance to inspect the state of the instance and fix any issues.
* The behavior of the final destroy action can be overridden if desired. Check out the CLI help for the `--destroy` flag using `kitchen help test`.
* The primary use case in mind for this meta-action is in a Continuous Integration environment or a command for developers to run before check in or after a fresh clone. If you're using this in your test-code-verify development cycle it's going to quickly become very slow and frustrating. You're better off running the **converge** and **verify** sub-commands in development and save the **test** sub-command when you need to verify the end-to-end run of your code.

Finally, let's check the status of the instance:
